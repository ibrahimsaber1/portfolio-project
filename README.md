# COVID-19 Data Analysis

## Overview

This SQL script performs various analyses on a COVID-19 dataset to extract meaningful insights. The analyses focus on different aspects such as the total cases, total deaths, death percentages, infection rates, and vaccination rates across different locations and continents.

## Analysis Breakdown

### 1. Data Selection
The script begins by selecting relevant data from the dataset where the continent is specified. This forms the basis for further analysis.

### 2. Total Cases vs. Total Deaths
This section calculates the death percentage relative to the total cases for specific locations, helping to understand the severity of the pandemic in those areas.

### 3. Case Percentage Compared to Population
The analysis calculates the percentage of the population that has been infected with COVID-19 in different locations. This gives an insight into how widespread the infection was in various regions.

### 4. Highest Infection Rate
Identifies countries with the highest infection rates relative to their population, highlighting regions that were most impacted.

### 5. Highest Death Count Relative to Population
This analysis focuses on countries with the highest death rates compared to their population, providing a perspective on the pandemic's deadliest areas.

### 6. Continent-Wise Breakdown
The script then aggregates data by continent to show how different continents were affected in terms of population, total deaths, and infection rates.

### 7. Global Numbers
This section provides a global overview by summing up the total cases and deaths across all continents, along with calculating the global death percentage.

### 8. Vaccination vs. Population
Analyzes vaccination data to compare the total vaccinations administered against the population size, indicating the extent of vaccination efforts.

### 9. Calculation Using CTE
Common Table Expressions (CTEs) are used to perform calculations such as total vaccinations over time, making it easier to analyze trends and perform complex queries.

### 10. Using Temporary Tables
Temporary tables are utilized to store intermediate results for further analysis, particularly for calculating vaccination percentages relative to the population.

### 11. Creating a View
Finally, the script creates a view to simplify future queries by encapsulating the vaccination data and related calculations.

## Conclusion
This SQL script provides a comprehensive analysis of COVID-19 data, offering insights into the pandemic's impact across different regions and continents. The use of various SQL techniques such as CTEs, temporary tables, and views makes the analysis efficient and easy to extend.
